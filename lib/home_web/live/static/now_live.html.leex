  Spending most of my time thinking about and working with LLMs at this point. It's hard to think about much else when it feels like we're on the cusp of a new paradigm. We're definitely in the middle of a massive hype cycle, and I probably spent too much time being skeptical about what these models could actually do but once I started really working with GPT-4 on the daily my mind was blown.

  My primary pastime right now is building <a href="https://brus.ai">brus.ai</a>.

  I'm reading a lot of technical books on ML atm as well as digging into books about thinking and the brain. It's cliche but it's extraordinarily fun to think about thinking :)
