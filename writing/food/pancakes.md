Apart from friends and family, the thing I miss the most about Sweden is the food, and especially my mother's pancakes.

Luckily, they're easy to make and I'm getting decent at replicating her magic at this point.

What follows is a combination of my parents' recipe, with Americanized
measurements :) If you try to make this please let me know how it goes!

This makes enough pancakes for three, maaaybe four people? Also works for two really
hungry individuals :)

**Ingredients**:
  - 1 Cup Flour
  - 2 Cups Milk
  - 2 Eggs
  - 1/2 tsp Salt
  - 2 Tbsp Butter

**Instructions:**

1. Start by combining the flour and salt in a medium sized bowl. (Everything is
   eventually going into this bowl).
2. Add half of the milk to the bowl and whisk until it combines smoothly.
3. Add the eggs, remaining milk and whisk until it's all smooth.
4. Let sit for 30 minutes.
5. Heat a cast-iron pan on medium heat for about 5 minutes. Melt half of the
   butter and combine with the pancake batter in the bowl.
6. Use the remaining butter to make sure that the pan is always lightly greased.
   (If you use too much butter I find that the pancakes don't get as good of a
   surface).
7. Make pancakes! I use 1/3 of a cup of the batter for each pancake.
